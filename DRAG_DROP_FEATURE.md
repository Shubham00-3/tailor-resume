## 🚀 How It Works

### **User Experience:**

1. **Drag & Drop**
   - Drag a resume file and drop it onto the upload area
   - Visual feedback with highlighted border

2. **Click to Browse**
   - Click the upload area to select a file
   - Standard file picker dialog

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **New Components:**

#### `FileUpload.jsx`
A reusable drag-and-drop upload component with:
- Drag & drop event handlers
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Loading states
- Error handling

### **File Parsing Libraries:**

```json
{
  "mammoth": "^1.8.0",      // DOCX text extraction
  "pdfjs-dist": "^3.11.174" // PDF text extraction
}
```

### **Features:**

1. **PDF Parsing**
   - Uses Mozilla's PDF.js library
   - Extracts text from all pages
   - Handles multi-page documents
   - CDN-based worker for performance

2. **DOCX Parsing**
   - Uses Mammoth.js library
   - Extracts raw text
   - Preserves basic formatting
   - Handles complex documents

3. **TXT Reading**
   - Native File API
   - UTF-8 encoding
   - Instant processing

## 📝 Usage Examples

### **Resume Upload:**

```
1. User drags `John_Doe_Resume.pdf` onto upload area
2. Component shows "Processing John_Doe_Resume.pdf..."
3. PDF is parsed and text is extracted
4. Resume textarea is populated with extracted text
5. Success message shows "File loaded successfully"
```

### **Job Description Upload:**

```
1. User clicks "Drop your file here or click to browse"
2. File picker opens
3. User selects `Senior_Developer_JD.docx`
